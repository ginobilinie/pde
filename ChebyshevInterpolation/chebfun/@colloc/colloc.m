classdef colloc < chebDiscretization
%COLLOC   Abstract class for collocation discretization of operators.
%   COLLOC is a partial implementation of CHEBDISCRETIZATION that creates
%   scaffolding common to first-kind and second-kind points. COLLOC cannot be
%   used directly as a discretization for linops. Both COLLOC1 and COLLOC2 are
%   full implementations.
%
% See also COLLOC1, COLLOC2, CHEBDISCRETIZATION.
